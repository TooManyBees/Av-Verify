man death guard~
a former Death Guard~
An imposing man dressed as a Death Guard beckons for challengers!
~
This frightening individual removes his shirt and tosses it to the
crowd, who cheer in appreciation. Grinning at the crowd's reaction,
the former Death Guard throws his arms open, calling for more
challengers to step forward---or to be thrown into the pit by the
bloodthirsty onlookers. As he sees you, the Death Guard's grin spreads
from ear to ear, and he readies his weapons to attack.

slender figure captured wizard~
a captured wizard~
A slender figure traces runes in the fighting pit's dirt floor.
~
This tall, well dressed woman seems a bit out of place in the blood-
soaked dirt of the pit. Nevertheless, if the pile of charred bodies
encircling her are any indication, she is not above killing her way
out of the arena.

man adventurer~
the adventurer~
A man in adventurer's garb looks ready to throw himself into the fray.
~
Still wincing from a blackjack blow to his neck, the man shakes off the
last traces of dizziness and pain, and gathers his surroundings with a
surprised look on his face. Throwing away his inhibitions, he sees you
and raises his fists to attack! Maybe he didn't learn his lesson the
first time when his hastiness got him thrown in here.

diminutive cowering prisoner man~
a cowering prisoner~
A diminutive man sticks to the shadows.
~
Paralyzed by the grisly sights around him, this prisoner is huddled on
the floor. He stares at you as you approach, obviously frightened but
at the same time frozen still, perhaps hoping that you will ignore him.

diminutive cowering prisoner man~
a cowering prisoner~
A terrified prisoner clings to the sides of the pit.
~
This pathetic man must have been tossed into the pit against his will,
either captured by the town watchmen, or by the mob of overeager fans
in the stands above. Apparently, he has decided that the best plan of
action is to hide until everyone loses interest in him. Which is never.

man soldier guard light~
Guard of the Light~
A man dressed as a Midgaard soldier sits at a table, sipping ale.
~
The Guard of the Light lifts his tankard to greet you, then takes a
delicate sip. Inviting you to sit down, he says, "Greetings, traveler!
Come here often?" He chuckles to himself. "No, I'm not a regular
myself. I came to test my skill in the arena. Normally, I'd just dismiss
this place and never give it another passing thought---so long as the
fine folk here stay out of "proper" Midgaard's business---but I've
heard stories of an ex-member of the Queen's Death Guard who made a name
for himself in the pit. An honest-to-goodness celebrity, in fact. And
that, my friend, is a challenge I can't ignore."

"They say he's a beast in the pit." The Guard of the Light slams his
tankard on the table and flashes a broad smile. "But we'll see about
that!"

woman bartender~
the bartender~
A large woman stands behind a bar, taking orders and bets.
~
The bartender hustles through the crowd, sliding drinks down the length
of the bar as she also shouts to the crowd gathered around the fighting
pit. Despite the commotion between the pit, its onlookers, and the
merrymakers at the bar, she picks your face out of the crowd and yells,
"Step up, already! Drinks are half price during a match. Or follow me to
risk life and limb in the pit, if that's more to your liking!"

skinny rogue weaponsmith vendor~
the rogue weaponsmith~
A skinny rogue leisurely balances a rapier on his finger.
~
The rogue vendor almost blends in to the wall behind him, his body more
resembling the rapier in his hands than his fellow townsfolk. He keeps
a beady eye on you while he adjusts his coat---no doubt concealing all
sorts of illicit wares.

jerome! leader~
Jerome, Paradise's master thief~
Jerome sits in seclusion, worrying himself away.
~
The aged thief is hunched over a table, arms crossed and brow furrowed.
He idly twirls a dagger between his fingers, and as you enter he gives
you a cursory glance and grumbles to himself.

"I told everyone in town not to bother me, so begone already. If you've
come to warn me again about the Black Circle, pipe down already. I said
I'd get rid of them, and I will just as long as you folks keep quiet and
let me concentrate!" He smirks. "Oh, and if you think you have the
bright idea of taking my place, go right ahead. Your first job as mayor
will be protecting Paradise from invisible assassins. So pick who you
want to deal with: me or them!"

With that, Jerome stabs his dagger into the table and points to the
door.

"I just need to figure out what they're planning, that's all... I think
I know what they're after, and I think they haven't found it yet." With
that, Jerome trails off, mumbling ideas to himself.
