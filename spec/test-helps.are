800 'PARIAHS PARADISE' UNDERWORLD 'MIDGAARD UNDERWORLD'~
Cities like Midgaard are built upon laws and the governing bodies that
enforce those laws. For most these are welcome securities, but a handful
of shady individuals find them to be stifling constraints. For them, the
only life worth living is one free of arbitrary rules and a haughty air
of civility. Midgaard's worst kept secret, then, is its seething
underworld: a parody of Midgaard above, carved out of its own aging
infrastructure, sewers and foundations which the citizens above happily
throw away and ignore. Its denizens farcically call it Paradise. Rumor
has it that even Midgaard's own official staff will on occasion indulge
themselves in Paradise's brand of violent entertainment.

800 'PARIAHS PARADISE STORY'~
Long ago, when dragons were 'Dragons-With-A-Capital-D' (perhaps during
or prior to the war between Tiamat and Bahamut), a black dragon died and
its corpse was covered by the earth and left to fossilize over the ages.
This was the same place that would become the foundation of Glasya's
temple, and eventually Midgaard. Some of the dragon's magic or spirit
still lingers in its bones, making them powerful artifacts. On a very
basic level, the spirit of the dragon is still sentient, and for some
reason it is subtly supporting the human inhabitants of Paradise and
Midgaard. (I like to think it's an act of passive aggression against
Quixoltan, in response to witnessing him banish dragonkind ages ago.)

Kahbyss somehow became aware of the dragon's remains in Avatar's present
day, and he has sent the Black Circle to retrieve them at all costs.
Kahbyss and his followers revere old dragons, especially of the black
variety, so the Black Circle is poised to strike at Paradise (and
possibly Midgaard city) as soon as the old dragon's remains are located.

In the lowest level of Paradise, in the city proper, there is a room
that branches off of the western road titled "|BG|An obstructed dirt tunnel|N|"
It is currently a dead end, but is implied to lead west toward a
construction site. This is where the inhabitants started expanding, but
stopped when they uncovered the bones of the old dragon. If there is to
be any expansion to this area, or a similarly themed area added, that
would be an interesting place to start. Also note that the location of
this area places it very near the Flipside Altar, although that is not
mentioned, nor does it currently play any role at all.
(But I *AM* Glasya's number one fan! GooOOOOO ABOMINATIONS OF NATURE!)
